                allow the customers to have a better way to do marketing and
                promotion with data analysis, breakdown reports, and set up a
                baseline to enable the promotions to run smoothly. Currently, I

                scan the advertisements for issues and notify the managers to
                take action and resolve the complications to allow the
                promotions to operate to their maximum potential.
